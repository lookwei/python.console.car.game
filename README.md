# A mini console car game implemented using Python

This is built for my students in COMP 1012. We implemented this mini game with 100+ lines of statements. The goal is to help them review what we have taught in the course (e.g., strings, loops, ASCII). We build this from scratch, and try to keep it as simple as possible. We're not intended to build a sophisticated game.
